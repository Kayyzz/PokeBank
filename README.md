# PokeBank
Hack the North 2019 Project created by Kevin Zhang, Anne Chung, Lizzie Kim and David Lu. 

## Introduction and what it does
PokeBank is an app that targets university students like ourselves, and encourages them to put money in their savings accounts whenever they can. 

Everytime the user transfers money to their savings account, they unlock in-game currency which they can use to buy loot boxes. This acts as something fun for the user to encourage them to save money. The user can also deposit money into their savings account with Alexa.
