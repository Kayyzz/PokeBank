# PokeBank
Hack the North 2019 Project created by Kevin Zhang, Anne Chung, Lizzie Kim and David Lu. 

## Introduction and what it does
PokeBank is an app that targets university students like ourselves, who don't have a ton of money while studying, and would like to budget their funds properly. 

Pokebank encourages students to budget properly and not to waste money on things they might not need such as video games or bubble tea.

PokeBank asks the user questions about their lifestyle, income, etc and creates a weekly budgeting goal for the user to meet. 
The user can input how much they would like to save, and they can change their budgeting goals every week to adjust to different changes.

Everytime the user meets their weekly budgeting goal, they can unlock in-game currency and Pokemon to collect. This acts as something fun for the user to encourage them to save money.

The app also has a feature which allows users to transfer money *(the extra money they save from budgeting properly)* into their Savings account. This can all be done through voice and Alexa.
